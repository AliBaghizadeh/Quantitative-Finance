# Quantitative_Finance

This repository documents my journey into the world of Quantitative Finance, driven by a fascination with models and coding in this exciting field of quantitative analysis. My approach involves taking relevant courses, reading key literature, and implementing some of the models in Python.

Courses
The courses that have significantly influenced my work in this project include:

Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python (EDHEC Business School) by Vijay Vaidyanathan and Martellini.
Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance (MITx 15.455x) by Paul F. Mende.
Applied Time Series Analysis in Python (Udemy) by Marco Peixeiro.
 

### Hardware and Software
I wrote the codes in either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code using a normal laptop. Whenever I needed computation power, I used Google CoLab or AWS Studio Lab. <br><br>
To accomplish the project, I have used the following packages:<br><be>

1- Tensorflow  version 2.10.0  <br>
2- scikit-learn    version 1.4.1.post1  <br>
3- Python          version 3.10.9 <br>
4- Statsmodel      versionn 0.14.0 <br>

### Files and Instructions

1- ***Time Series Model Generator***:  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file benefits from a TimeSeriesGenerator generator class to generate some time series models like Monte Carlo paths, Geometric Brownian Motion, Autoregressive and Moving Average models plus  plotiing options for generated time series processes.<br>
