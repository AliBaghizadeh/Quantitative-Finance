# Quantitative_Finance

This repository documents my journey into the world of Quantitative Finance, driven by a fascination with models and coding in this exciting field of quantitative analysis. My approach involves taking relevant courses, reading key literature, and implementing some of the models in Python.

## Courses
The courses that have significantly influenced my work in this project include:

Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python (EDHEC Business School) by Vijay Vaidyanathan and Martellini. <br>
Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance (MITx 15.455x) by Paul F. Mende. <br>
Applied Time Series Analysis in Python (Udemy) by Marco Peixeiro. <br>
Quantitative Finance & Algorithmic Trading in Python (Udemy) by Holczer Balazs.  <br>
 

### Hardware and Software
I developed the code on a standard laptop using either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code. For computationally intensive tasks, I utilized Google Colab or AWS Studio Lab.:<br><be>

1- Tensorflow  version 2.10.0  <br>
2- scikit-learn    version 1.4.1.post1  <br>
3- Python          version 3.10.9 <br>
4- Statsmodel      versionn 0.14.0 <br>

### Files and Instructions

1- ***Time Series Model Generator***:  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This module includes a TimeSeriesGenerator class designed to generate various time series models such as Monte Carlo paths, Geometric Brownian Motion, Autoregressive, and Moving Average models. It also offers plotting options for visualizing these generated time series processes.<br>

2- ***markowitz_portfolio***:  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file is a class to implement the Markowitz Algorithm for constructing a portfolio of different stocks. The stocks are downloaded from Yahoo Finance, and the output shows the optimal portfolio based on parameters like return and risk. Examples of generated Stock_Price and Optimal_Portfolio are given as png images. <br>
