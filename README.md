# Quantitative_Finance

This is a personal project, my journey towards Quantitative Finance, and I have been fascinated by models and coding in this exciting field of quantitative analysis. My approach is taking courses or reading parts of some books, and trying to produce some of the models in Python. 

 

### Hardware and Software
I wrote the codes in either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code using a normal laptop. Whenever I needed computation power, I used Google CoLab or AWS Studio Lab. <br><br>
To accomplish the project, I have used the following packages:<br><be>

1- Tensorflow  version 2.10.0  <br>
2- scikit-learn    version 1.4.1.post1  <br>
3- Python          version 3.10.9 <br>
4- Statsmodel      versionn 0.14.0 <br>

### Files and Instructions

1- ***Time Series Model Generator***:  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file benefits from a TimeSeriesGenerator generator class to generate some time series models like Monte Carlo paths, Geometric Brownian Motion, Autoregressive and Moving Average models plus  plotiing options for generated time series processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Keras and in case you need to preserve the structure of the folder of the original images and classes. I recommend having a test dataset 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well. <br>
